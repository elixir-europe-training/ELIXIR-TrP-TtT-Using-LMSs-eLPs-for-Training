#### **Session 1: Introduction to e-Learning Platforms for training delivery**

##### The **learning outcomes** of session 1 is that learners will be able to:

* Understand the core functions and benefits of e-learning platforms (LMS).  
* Identify the role of LMS in supporting digital training delivery.  
* Understand how EeLP and e-learning platforms facilitate interactive learning environments.

Learning Management Systems (LMS) provide robust digital environments designed to facilitate interactive, engaging, and effective training experiences. LMS platforms typically include features such as content management, multimedia integration, interactive communication channels, and analytics for learner assessment - typically four levels: descriptive, diagnostic, predictive, and prescriptive[^1]. According to research, these platforms offer significant advantages including flexibility, scalability, and enhanced learner engagement[^2].  
For example, the ELIXIR-SI eLearning Platform (EeLP) is tailored specifically for bioinformatics training, incorporating user-friendly navigation, seamless integration of diverse ELIXIR-supported digital resources, and tools for facilitating interactive and dynamic learning scenarios. Its intuitive interface allows for easy navigation and customisation, facilitating the practical application of theoretical knowledge from prior training modules.  
EeLP offers functionalities that allow trainers to create tutorials, showcase tools, and conduct interactive exercises. This module focuses on bridging the gap between theoretical training principles introduced in earlier modules and their practical implementation, helping trainers understand the "how-to" aspects of delivering effective digital training.  
EeLP is a Moodle-based LMS that enables export of tutorials and courses in SCORM2 (*Sharable Content Object Reference Model, version 2*) standard format. This ensures compatibility with a range of SCORM2-compliant LMSs, such as Canvas, and allows direct migration to other Moodle-based LMSs.

#### **Session 2: Designing interactive tutorials with e-Learning Platforms**

##### The **learning outcomes** of session 2 is that learners will be able to:

* Understand the principles of designing multimedia-based e-learning tutorials.  
* Apply instructional design frameworks for effective tutorial creation.  
* Understand how tools in EeLP support tutorial interactivity and feedback.

Interactive tutorials within LMS platforms combine multiple multimedia resources, such as videos, text, images, and animations, which enhance comprehension and retention of complex information. The effectiveness of tutorials depends on well specified learning objectives and methodological design: use Bloom’s Taxonomy[^3] to declare the target cognitive level (e.g. explain, analyze, create), then apply an instructional design model to map those objectives to aligned activities, feedback and assessments to guide learners through the educational content.  
An illustrative example is EeLP, where trainers can create comprehensive, multimedia-rich tutorials that include embedded quizzes and feedback mechanisms. Such tutorials significantly boost engagement and allow trainers to promptly assess and address learner misconceptions or knowledge gaps. This feature could, for example, extend the instructional design component (video/presentation portion of TtT, that is part where participants plan, produce and deliver short instructional videos) by allowing learners to create e.g. interactive lessons with embedded quizzes and feedback mechanisms. Participants can post their content in the forum, encouraging peer interaction through comments and feedback. Learner-generated content can also be organised in a database to centrally manage and display all participants' contributions. Privacy/access settings are highly customisable.

#### **Session 3: Showcase sessions through LMS**

##### The **learning outcomes** of session 3 is that learners will be able to:

* Explain the value of demonstration-based learning in digital environments.  
* Explore techniques for conducting effective showcase sessions in LMS.  
* Demonstrate how EeLP supports real-time demonstrations and participant interaction.

Showcase sessions within LMS environments allow trainers to practically demonstrate bioinformatics tools, platforms, or methodologies. Research supports the effectiveness of demonstration-based learning, emphasizing its potential to bridge theory and practice effectively, especially when combined with interactive elements such as discussions or collaborative feedback sessions[^4].  
EeLP serves as an excellent example, enabling seamless integration and demonstration of specialised bioinformatics tools directly within learning modules. It further supports interactive elements such as discussion forums, live chats, and Q&A sessions, enriching the demonstration experience and encouraging learner participation and collaboration.

#### **Session 4: Developing interactive exercises for skill application**

##### The **learning outcomes** of session 4 is that learners will be able to:

* Explain the importance of scenario-based learning.  
* Design interactive exercises that promote practical skill development.  
* Utilise EeLP to create realistic and relevant digital training scenarios.

The inclusion of interactive, scenario-based exercises in LMS platforms enhances practical skill development and knowledge transfer. Scenario-based learning exercises simulate real-world tasks, promoting problem-solving and application of theoretical concepts in practice. Effective scenarios typically involve authentic tasks reflective of actual professional practices, thereby enhancing learner motivation and relevance[^5].  
EeLP could effectively exemplify this by supporting interactive bioinformatics exercises. For example, EeLP can host an RNA‑seq course by reusing the existing materials, datasets, and tools from community materials e.g., Galaxy Training Network or ELIXIR SPLASH, then framing the course in EeLP with prerequisites and clear instructions. Add short checkpoints (intermediate lessons/quizzes), provide spaces for assignment uploads (figures, results, notebooks) and for feedback (forum/chat/teacher comments). Once enough participation data accumulate (assessments, assignments, feedback), analyse outcomes (e.g., completion rates, item analysis) to propose targeted improvements. Finally, package the result as a reusable EeLP template for other trainers, enabling quick replication and adaptation to new cohorts.

#### **Session 5: Assessment and evaluation within e-Learning Platforms**

##### The **learning outcomes** of session 5 is that learners will be able to:

* Differentiate between formative and summative assessment strategies.  
* Use LMS tools to monitor and evaluate learner progress effectively.  
* Use EeLP assessment analytics (e.g. item difficulty, completion rates), propose one design change to the module.

Comprehensive assessment tools integrated into LMS platforms enable trainers to systematically evaluate learner performance and measure training effectiveness. Assessments are generally categorised as formative or summative, each serving distinct purposes. Formative assessments are important to provide continuous feedback that informs adaptive teaching strategies, while summative assessments offer a holistic evaluation of learner competencies upon completion of instructional activities[^6].  
EeLP exemplifies this functionality by incorporating advanced analytics and reporting features, which facilitate detailed tracking of learner engagement, progress, and outcomes. Trainers can thus make informed adjustments to enhance training quality and ensure the effective integration of theoretical knowledge and practical competencies.

#### **Session 6: Conclusion and next steps**

##### The **learning outcomes** of session 6 is that learners will be able to:

* Summarise key insights from the application of EeLP / LMS in training delivery.  
* Identify forward-looking strategies to improve digital training ecosystems.  
* Apply reusable course templates in streamlining training development in platforms such as EeLP.

E-learning platforms have simplified training by enabling the integration of theory and practical skill application through comprehensive digital environments. The strategic use of interactive tutorials, showcase sessions, and practical exercises ensures that learners not only acquire knowledge but also develop applicable skills essential for their professional growth.  
Future steps include continuous monitoring of technological advancements (including the use of AI methods) and pedagogical approaches within e-learning, alongside regular feedback from trainees and trainers. Adapting to evolving learner needs and integrating new methodologies will ensure sustained effectiveness and relevance of LMS platforms. A particularly important future step is the development of template courses within EeLP, enabling different content providers to streamline course creation processes. Research supports this strategy[^7],[^8], highlighting that templates can significantly reduce content preparation time, improve consistency and quality, and facilitate knowledge transfer among trainers and institutions. The EeLP platform combines robust technical features with specialised content integration, and will continue to provide valuable blueprints for future e-learning advancements.
