LMS platforms typically include features such as content management, multimedia integration, interactive communication channels, and analytics for learner assessment - typically four levels: descriptive, diagnostic, predictive, and prescriptive.<sup>1</sup> According to research, these platforms offer significant advantages including flexibility, scalability, and enhanced learner engagement.<sup>2</sup></p> <p>For example, the ELIXIR-SI eLearning Platform (EeLP) is tailored specifically for bioinformatics training, incorporating user-friendly navigation, seamless integration of diverse ELIXIR-supported digital resources, and tools for facilitating interactive and dynamic learning scenarios.

The effectiveness of tutorials depends on well specified learning objectives and methodological design: use Bloom\u2019s Taxonomy.<sup>1</sup> to declare the target cognitive level (e.g. explain, analyze, create), then apply an instructional design model to map those objectives to aligned activities, feedback and assessments to guide learners through the educational content.</p> <p> An illustrative example is EeLP, where trainers can create comprehensive, multimedia-rich tutorials that include embedded quizzes and feedback mechanisms. Such tutorials significantly boost engagement and allow trainers to promptly assess and address learner misconceptions or knowledge gaps. This feature could, for example, extend the instructional design component (video/presentation portion of TtT, that is part where participants plan, produce and deliver short instructional videos) by allowing learners to create e.g. interactive lessons with embedded quizzes and feedback mechanisms. Participants can post their content in the forum, encouraging peer interaction through comments and feedback.

Strong scenarios are built around tasks that resemble real professional duties, helping learners see the direct relevance of the content and increasing their motivation to participate.<sup>1</sup></p> <p>EeLP could effectively exemplify this by supporting interactive bioinformatics exercises. For example, EeLP can host an RNA\u2011seq course by reusing the existing materials, datasets, and tools from community materials e.g., Galaxy Training Network or ELIXIR SPLASH, then framing the course in EeLP with prerequisites and clear instructions. Add short checkpoints (intermediate lessons/quizzes), provide spaces for assignment uploads (figures, results, notebooks) and for feedback (forum/chat/teacher comments). Once enough participation data accumulate (assessments, assignments, feedback), analyse outcomes (e.g., completion rates, item analysis) to propose targeted improvements.
