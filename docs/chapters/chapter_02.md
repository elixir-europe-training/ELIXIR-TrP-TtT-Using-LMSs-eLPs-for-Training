## Designing interactive tutorials with e-Learning Platforms

The learning outcomes of session 2 is that learners will be able to:
- Understand the principles of designing multimedia-based e-learning tutorials.
- Apply instructional design frameworks for effective tutorial creation.
- Understand how tools in EeLP support tutorial interactivity and feedback.

Interactive tutorials within LMS platforms combine multiple multimedia resources, such as videos, text, images, and animations, which enhance comprehension and retention of complex information. The effectiveness of tutorials depends on well specified learning objectives and methodological design: use Bloom’s Taxonomy.[^3] to declare the target cognitive level (e.g. explain, analyze, create), then apply an instructional design model to map those objectives to aligned activities, feedback and assessments to guide learners through the educational content.

<p style="margin-right: 50px;"> An illustrative example is EeLP, where trainers can create comprehensive, multimedia-rich tutorials that include embedded quizzes and feedback mechanisms. Such tutorials significantly boost engagement and allow trainers to promptly assess and address learner misconceptions or knowledge gaps. This feature could, for example, extend the instructional design component (video/presentation portion of TtT, that is part where participants plan, produce and deliver short instructional videos) by allowing learners to create e.g. interactive lessons with embedded quizzes and feedback mechanisms. Participants can post their content in the forum, encouraging peer interaction through comments and feedback. Learner-generated content can also be organised in a database to centrally manage and display all participants' contributions. Privacy/access settings are highly customisable.</p>
