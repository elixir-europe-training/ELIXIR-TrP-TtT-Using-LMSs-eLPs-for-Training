## Introduction to e-Learning Platforms for training delivery
The learning outcomes of session 1 is that learners will be able to:

- Understand the core functions and benefits of e-learning platforms (LMS).
- Identify the role of LMS in supporting digital training delivery.
- Understand how EeLP and e-learning platforms facilitate interactive learning environments.

Learning Management Systems (LMS) provide robust digital environments designed to facilitate interactive, engaging, and effective training experiences. LMS platforms typically include features such as content management, multimedia integration, interactive communication channels, and analytics for learner assessment - typically four levels: descriptive, diagnostic, predictive, and prescriptive.[^1] According to research, these platforms offer significant advantages including flexibility, scalability, and enhanced learner engagement.[^2]

<p style="margin-right: 50px;">For example, the ELIXIR-SI eLearning Platform (EeLP) is tailored specifically for bioinformatics training, incorporating user-friendly navigation, seamless integration of diverse ELIXIR-supported digital resources, and tools for facilitating interactive and dynamic learning scenarios. Its intuitive interface allows for easy navigation and customisation, facilitating the practical application of theoretical knowledge from prior training modules.</p>

<p style="margin-right: 50px;">EeLP offers functionalities that allow trainers to create tutorials, showcase tools, and conduct interactive exercises. This module focuses on bridging the gap between theoretical training principles introduced in earlier modules and their practical implementation, helping trainers understand the "how-to" aspects of delivering effective digital training.</p>

<p style="margin-right: 50px;">EeLP is a Moodle-based LMS that enables export of tutorials and courses in SCORM2 (Sharable Content Object Reference Model, version 2) standard format. This ensures compatibility with a range of SCORM2-compliant LMSs, such as Canvas, and allows direct migration to other Moodle-based LMSs.</p>
