## Developing interactive exercises for skill application
The learning outcomes of session 4 is that learners will be able to:
- Explain the importance of scenario-based learning.
- Design interactive exercises that promote practical skill development.
- Utilise EeLP to create realistic and relevant digital training scenarios.

The inclusion of interactive, scenario-based exercises in LMS platforms enhances practical skill development and knowledge transfer. Scenario-based learning places learners in realistic situations where they must think through challenges and apply what they have learned. Strong scenarios are built around tasks that resemble real professional duties, helping learners see the direct relevance of the content and increasing their motivation to participate.[^5]

<p style="margin-right: 50px;">EeLP could effectively exemplify this by supporting interactive bioinformatics exercises. For example, EeLP can host an RNA‑seq course by reusing the existing materials, datasets, and tools from community materials e.g., Galaxy Training Network or ELIXIR SPLASH, then framing the course in EeLP with prerequisites and clear instructions. Add short checkpoints (intermediate lessons/quizzes), provide spaces for assignment uploads (figures, results, notebooks) and for feedback (forum/chat/teacher comments). Once enough participation data accumulate (assessments, assignments, feedback), analyse outcomes (e.g., completion rates, item analysis) to propose targeted improvements. Finally, package the result as a reusable EeLP template for other trainers, enabling quick replication and adaptation to new cohorts.</p>
