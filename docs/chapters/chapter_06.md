## LMS Insights and Future Strategies
The learning outcomes of session 6 is that learners will be able to:
- Summarise key insights from the application of EeLP / LMS in training delivery.
- Identify forward-looking strategies to improve digital training ecosystems.
- Apply reusable course templates in streamlining training development in platforms such as EeLP.

E-learning platforms have simplified training by enabling the integration of theory and practical skill application through comprehensive digital environments. The strategic use of interactive tutorials, showcase sessions, and practical exercises ensures that learners not only acquire knowledge but also develop applicable skills essential for their professional growth.
Future steps include continuous monitoring of technological advancements (including the use of AI methods) and pedagogical approaches within e-learning, alongside regular feedback from trainees and trainers. Adapting to evolving learner needs and integrating new methodologies will ensure sustained effectiveness and relevance of LMS platforms. A particularly important future step is the development of template courses within EeLP, enabling different content providers to streamline course creation processes. Research supports this strategy.[^7][^8], highlighting that templates can significantly reduce content preparation time, improve consistency and quality, and facilitate knowledge transfer among trainers and institutions. The EeLP platform combines robust technical features with specialised content integration, and will continue to provide valuable blueprints for future e-learning advancements.
