## Showcase sessions through LMS
The learning outcomes of session 3 is that learners will be able to:
- Explain the value of demonstration-based learning in digital environments.
- Explore techniques for conducting effective showcase sessions in LMS.
- Demonstrate how EeLP supports real-time demonstrations and participant interaction.

Showcase sessions within LMS environments allow trainers to practically demonstrate bioinformatics tools, platforms, or methodologies. Research supports the effectiveness of demonstration-based learning, emphasizing its potential to bridge theory and practice effectively, especially when combined with interactive elements such as discussions or collaborative feedback sessions.[^4]

<p style="margin-right: 50px;">EeLP serves as an excellent example, enabling seamless integration and demonstration of specialised bioinformatics tools directly within learning modules. It further supports interactive elements such as discussion forums, live chats, and Q&A sessions, enriching the demonstration experience and encouraging learner participation and collaboration.</p>
