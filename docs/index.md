## Lesson overview

!!! overview ""
    :fontawesome-regular-bookmark: **Description**  
    The ELIXIR-SI eLearning Platform (EeLP) offers a robust, versatile, and user-friendly environment for training delivery, with possibilities for integrating many ELIXIR-supported tools. This is an open-access module that addresses practical aspects of the theoretical knowledge gained in the core Train-the-Trainer modules and how training can be served as a tutorial, showcase, and an interactive exercise. This approach enhances the learning experience and leverages the capabilities of the EeLP to demonstrate not only practical use of digital platforms in training delivery but also the quality and effectiveness of training resources within the ELIXIR community, streamlined into a proof-of-concept learning management system supported with ELIXIR tools and resources. The module focuses on the "how-to" aspects of using EeLP, incorporating exercises directly linked to EeLP functionalities and making clear distinctions between theoretical and general training knowledge from previous modules and the practical skills being developed.
